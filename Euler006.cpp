/* Problem:
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1e2 + 2e2 + ... + 10e2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)e2 = 55e2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first 
ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
 one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
